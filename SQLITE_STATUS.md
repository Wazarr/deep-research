## SQLite Implementation Status

### âœ… WORKING CORE FUNCTIONALITY
- SQLite database with Drizzle ORM: âœ… 
- Node.js runtime (51 API routes): âœ…
- Edge Runtime isolation fix: âœ…
- User authentication system: âœ…
- Database persistence: âœ…
- Storage factory pattern: âœ…

### ðŸš§ INCOMPLETE AREAS  
- DatabaseKnowledgeManager missing methods: processFile, processUrl, processText, validateOwnership
- Many API routes still have undefined manager references from sed script migration
- Some Drizzle query type issues in complex database managers

### ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS
1. Implement missing methods in database managers
2. Fix remaining undefined manager references  
3. Resolve Drizzle type issues
4. Full feature parity with memory storage

**The main Edge Runtime problem is SOLVED - auth works perfectly!**
